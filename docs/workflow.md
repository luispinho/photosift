# Workflow

PhotoSift is designed around a fast, keyboard-driven workflow:

1. **Open your photo folder** - Point PhotoSift to your camera's output folder
2. **Review each photo** - High-quality JPEG previews load instantly
3. **Make quick decisions** - Use keyboard shortcuts for rapid culling
4. **Stay in flow** - Non-destructive actions happen immediately; destructive actions use smart confirmations
5. **Track progress** - Visual indicators show which photos you've processed
6. **Resume anytime** - Your session state is automatically saved

## Smart Confirmation System

For safety, PhotoSift uses an innovative confirmation system for destructive actions:

- **Immediate navigation** - Move to the next photo right away
- **Background countdown** - Destructive actions execute after a brief delay
- **Easy undo** - Press `U` if you change your mind
- **No workflow interruption** - No popup dialogs to slow you down
