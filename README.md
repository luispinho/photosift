A fast and lightweight photo culling application for Canon DSLR files, designed to help photographers quickly sort through their photos and decide which files to keep, delete, or process further.

## Motivation

Most existing photo management solutions feel overcomplicated for the simple task of culling photos after a shoot. They often require importing photos into catalogs, navigating complex interfaces, or switching between multiple tools. PhotoSift was created to solve this specific workflow pain point with a single-purpose, lightning-fast application that lets you:

- **Skip the import process** - Work directly with your files without catalog overhead
- **Make decisions quickly** - Simple keyboard shortcuts and immediate visual feedback
- **Stay focused** - No distracting features, just the essentials for photo culling
- **Work efficiently** - Smart confirmation system with undo capabilities for safety without friction

PhotoSift is for photographers who want to get through the initial culling process as quickly as possible and move on to the creative work that matters.
